# Serverless WebSocket Client

A simple client for [Serverless WebSocket Example](https://github.com/nicolomaioli/sls-ws-example). A demo is running [here](https://nicolomaioli.github.io/sls-ws-example-client).

## Run

**Note**: The WebSocket URL is hard-coded in the `wsUrl` variable in `scripts/script.js`, you might want to change it if you have deployed your own backend.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
